# Data Science and Analysis project -1 
Idea: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data


# Description:

In this project, I have worked with a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions.
